# KnowLineCoffee 
A Django web application that allows users to see current wait times at local coffee shops

## Idea
To learn the Django framework, I am building a web-application that will allow users to enter current wait times at local coffee shops. The idea is that as the end users grow in number, the app will be able to provide an accurate estimate of waiting time - based on real input from other users. 

## Goal
To ship a hybrid app to users in a simple and clean user interface.
